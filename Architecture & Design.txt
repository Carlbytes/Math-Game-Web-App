Our project is a C++ desktop application built in Visual Studio, featuring a simple GUI and a cloud-hosted MySQL database. 
This stack leverages our team's C++ skills for performance, while MySQL offers a straightforward and reliable data storage solution suitable for our project's scope.

The primary risk is user data security. We'll mitigate this by hashing all passwords before they're stored in the database. 
A second risk involves potential network failures or invalid login attempts, which will be managed through comprehensive error handling to ensure system stability and prevent unauthorized access.

Our key priorities are robust security for all user credentials and a high degree of usability, delivered through an intuitive and responsive user interface.
